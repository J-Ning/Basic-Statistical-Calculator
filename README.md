# Basic-Statistical-Calculator
takes a dataset (e.g., an array or list of numbers) and calculates basic statistical metrics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance

Uses: Arrays, loops, and mathematical operations. 

    Mean: The average of the dataset.
    Median: The middle value of the sorted dataset.
    Mode: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.   
    Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.
    Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance.



Usage: Analyze a dataset of temperatures to find the average and standard deviation.
